# Freelancer Financial Dashboard

A complete financial dashboard for freelancers.

## Getting Started

The Freelancer Financial Dashboard is an application designed to address the unique financial management needs of freelancers. It will provide an all-in-one platform to track irregular income, manage multiple client invoices, and gain a clear picture of financial health. The app will feature income tracking, push notifications for late invoices, invoice generation, in-app file sharing, exporting the file as a PDF and insightful reports with visual analytics. It aims to help freelancers make informed financial decisions, stay organised, and save time by centralising all financial information in one intuitive dashboard.
